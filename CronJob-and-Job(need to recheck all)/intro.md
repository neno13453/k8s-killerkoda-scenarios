# Automating Tasks with Jobs and CronJobs in Kubernetes

Welcome to **Finlytics Inc.**, where you’re part of the platform team. Your mission is to automate backend tasks using Kubernetes **Jobs** and **CronJobs**.

You’ll use Jobs for **one-time tasks** like generating reports, and CronJobs for **recurring tasks** like daily cleanup or sending email digests.

In this lab, you’ll:
- Create Jobs that run to completion
- Schedule recurring jobs with Cron syntax
- Simulate failure and retry logic
- Control concurrency and job history

Let’s get started!
