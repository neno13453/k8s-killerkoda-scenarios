> For Kubernetes troubleshooting, mostly there are 2 commands that we will use; `kubectl describe po <podname>` and `kubectl logs -p <podname>`
<br>

Try to check the current state of each pod by runnung
```
kubectl get po
```{{copy}}

Then, try to fix the issue accordingly

Hint
<!-- INTERACTIVE copy START -->

```bash
echo 'Hello, world!'
```
<!-- INTERACTIVE copy END -->
